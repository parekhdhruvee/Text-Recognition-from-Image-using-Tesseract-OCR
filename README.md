# Text-Recognition-from-Image-using-Tesseract-OCR
A Python project for text recognition from images using Tesseract OCR would involve using the Tesseract library to recognize text from images. Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine that can recognize over 100 languages and is widely used for optical character recognition tasks. Further it converts the recognized speech into a MP3 file.
